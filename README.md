DESCRIPTION

hsh is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes it


HOW HSH WORKS

Prints a prompt and waits for a command from the user
Creates a child process in which the command is checked
Checks for built-ins, aliases in the PATH, and local executable programs
The child process is replaced by the command, which accepts arguments
When the command is done, the program returns to the parents process and prints the prompt
The program is ready to receive a new command
To exit: press Ctrl-D or enter "exit" (with or without a status)
Works also in non interactive mode


COMPILATION

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
